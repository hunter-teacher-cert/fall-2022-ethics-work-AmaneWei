You may have heard that some schools are implementing a required contact tracing smartphone app.  We will not be implementing such a program at our school at this time. We are using our standard contract tracing program to keep students and staff safe.  

Reasons why we are not implementing a contract tracing app: 

We have information security concerns: what do the apps have access to and what do they do with the data?
There are significant legal and ethical questions regarding asking students to install apps on a private device
Not everyone has a phone, so regular contact tracing is still required - time and effort is not saved for the district.
Do the apps keep up to date with changing county/state definitions of “exposure?”
Can we be sure that users of the apps are reporting accurate information?
Students “prank” the system by claiming COVID and then all their friends would be “close contacts”
If extra barriers put up to ensuring no false negative claims, it’s likely there are many positive covid that are unreported
Security flaws, security breaches?
Exclusionary concerns

Conditions under which an app might be reconsidered?
Funds provided for mandatory school devices for all students
Ensure that only location data is used for app, data is not shared with 3rd parties
Written assurance that clearly established legal and ethical standards are met by app creators.
